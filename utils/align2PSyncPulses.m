% Program to align two sync pulses from logs (or from log and npix)
%   In this function, the timebase in log1 (log1.Time)
%   is shifted to the timebase in log2 (log2.Time),
%   and the resultant timebase is appended to log1 as log1.realignedTime
%
%   If you would like to align log timebase to npix timebase, you should therefore
%   include the npix as the second input
